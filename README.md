Gym Buy High Sell Low is an OpenAI Gym simulated stock market environment that allows using it to train agents to do favorable trades. Please, don't use this for serious purposes. The goal for this project is personal learning.

Obviously, "buy high, sell low" is an attempt at sarcastic humour and would be a horrible way to do trading.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 (probably works with earlier versions)

## Getting started

Linux and macOS:
```bash

# create and enter a Python environment here before proceding
pip install requirements/requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

To use the project, follow these steps:

```
> import gym
